# NodeTrellis MindMap

NodeTrellis powers an interactive mind-mapping workspace where you can generate, edit, and explore graphs of ideas. The web app lives at https://nodetrellis.com/ and ships with a focused Combination Explorer at https://nodetrellis.com/combinationexplorer.

## NodeTrellis highlights
- Prompt the system with any topic or URL, copy the pre-built LLM prompt, then paste JSON responses back into the renderer to visualise them instantly.
- Import, export, or paste JSON directly; sample data loads automatically on first visit so you can test the workflow fast.
- Manage every node in-place: select all, add children, collapse branches, delete subtrees, or copy text with the radial menu.
- Bring your own OpenAI key: hold or right-click the API Render button to choose GPT-5 reasoning models, watch live character counts, and stop calls mid-stream.
- Keep large maps searchable with highlight-as-you-type Find controls, next/previous navigation buttons, and a zoom slider that stays pinned to the toolbar.
- Tweak layouts with continuous Cola physics, reheat anti-tangle behaviour, and tuned colour palettes built for dark backgrounds.

## Combination Explorer
- Load or paste a structured JSON model describing named sets, then walk every k-combination with range sliders, set checkboxes, and synced summaries.
- Generate fresh models through Copy Prompt or API Render, import/export snippets with clipboard buttons, and manage OpenAI keys from the same panel.
- Handle up to seven-set models, collapse the data panel when you need more canvas, and let the explorer highlight whichever combination you inspect.
- Use the help overlay for a quick tour, then click combos in the list or drag the rank slider to move through lexicographic order.
